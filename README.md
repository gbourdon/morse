# morse

### A plaintext to morse code converter written in Ruby

## Using morse in Ruby

In `Ruby` is file called `morse.rb`. Run it.

### Advanced

You can pre-specify the mode you are using via augments

- `-e` - Encode the message
- `-d` - Decode the message

## Using morse in C++

The project was built in CodeBlocks, so just open the `morse.cbp` file to open it. Running the completed file is very similar to the Ruby version, but augments do not work.
